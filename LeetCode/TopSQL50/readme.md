# LeetCode's TopSQL50

LeetCode's TopSQL50 is a series of beginner to intermediate challenges for people new to SQL. It may be found [here](https://leetcode.com/studyplan/top-sql-50/).

As of date (240619) I have currently finished DataCamp's course on _Beginner SQL_ and _Intermediate SQL_, and I have completed two of their three intermediate SQL projects. I plan to start working through LeetCode's content after finishing DataCamp's course [Joining Data in SQL](https://campus.datacamp.com/courses/joining-data-in-sql/introducing-inner-joins?ex=1).

LeetCode's TopSQL50 contains _ sections:
1. Select (5 problems)
2. Joins (9 problems)
3. Basic Aggregates (8 problems)
4. Sorting & Grouping (7 problems)
5. Advanced Select & Joins (7 problems)
6. Subqueries (7 problems)

//Convert the above into a table so I can check off when I complete things
