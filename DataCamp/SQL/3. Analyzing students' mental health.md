# Analyzing students' mental health

Does going to university in a different country affect your mental health? A Japanese international university surveyed its students in 2018 and published a study the following year that was approved by several ethical and regulatory boards.

The study found that international students have a higher risk of mental health difficulties than the general population, and that social connectedness (belonging to a social group) and acculturative stress (stress associated with joining a new culture) are predictive of depression.

Explore the `students` data using PostgreSQL to find out if you would come to a similar conclusion for international students and see if the length of stay is a contributing factor.

Here is a data description of the columns you may find helpful.

## Project progress

[âˆš] Created GitHub landing page  

[] Tried project once by myself  

[] Checked solution â€” annotated what I learned if my answer was wrong  

[] Document will not be edited further

  ## Preliminary questions 
I would like to run a few queries to see what this database looks like before I begin attempting to answer the assignment's questions.

### Question I: What am I working with, here?

```
SELECT * 
FROM students
LIMIT 10;
```

Impressions:
* That's... that's... a massive amount of columns
* Ok, I guess I'm going to start by `COUNT()`'ing some of the pieces of data and getting rough `AVG()`'s of other things

  ## Assignment questions 

  ### ðŸŽ¯ Question #1: How does staying in a different country impact your mental health?
  
Question text:
> Explore and analyze the students data to see how the length of stay (stay) impacts the average mental health diagnostic scores of the international students present in the study.
>
> Requriements:
> * Nine rows, five columns
> * Column namess & order: `stay`, `count_int`, `average_phq`, `average_scs`, and `average_as`
> * `AVG()` columns should be rounded to 2 decimal places
> * `count_int` column should show how many learners stayed for each "time interval"
> * Results sorted in descending order
>
> Notes: This might take multiple cells/queries!

Impression:
* This is a long question!
* I haven't done a project that required multiple queries working together before..
* I need to review how `ROUND()` works
* What's a DataFrame? Is it a thing, or just a DataCamp thing?
