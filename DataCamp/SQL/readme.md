# For your viewing sanity

This folder contains my solutions to the 11 SQL projects currently available on DataCamp as of June, 2024. Each file "shows my work", by which I mean to say that I include incorrect query attempts, what I learn from those errors, and also my initial thoughts/impressions on each problem. 

Note that the <1. ... 2. ... 3. ...> files are the first three files I created on Github. They were practice for both GitHub and Markdown. The formatting is atrocious and I don't currently have the heart to go back and clean them up. Files from <4 ...> on are significantly more readable.

In each project I make note of:
* Key learnings, indicated by üß†
* Questions/curiosities, indicated by ‚ùì

Answers to those things will not be provided within the project document. For ease of access later, I transfer these things to [Key Learnings](https://github.com/SuikaCider/coding_practice/blob/main/DataCamp/SQL/0.%20DataCamp%20key%20learnings.md) after finishing each project. I will update these questions with responses at a later date, once I'm better at SQL.
